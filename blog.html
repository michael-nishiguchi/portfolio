         <p>I used the Samsung Gear Iconx (2018) for about a year. I absolutely loved having no cord. It was a great improvement from the days of having my dog jump on me and rip my wired headphones out.</p>
         <p>These are advertised  to have a 5 hour battery life and in my experience, it got pretty close to 5 hours. The included case charges the earbuds from 0-100%. The case charges with USB-C, which is great. When I travel, I take my Nintendo Switch charger, which charges my phone, headphones and Switch. As much as I liked these headphones, I had a lot of issues with them failing. I ended up returning them several times because one ear would get quieter than the other and one pair had some connection issues.</p>
         <p>From what I've read, the Iconx have had a lot of the issues because they have very poor waterproofing and I primarily used them for running. I received a pair of the new Samsung Buds with my Galaxy S10 and they have improved the waterproofing. I have now used them for a couple weeks and have been very happy with them. The battery life is a little longer and I haven't had the same issues that I had with last year's model. Apple just announced a new version of their AirPods and the model with wireless charging costs a whopping $200. The Samsung Buds retail for $130.</p>
